Financial Risk & Customer Analytics (SQL Project)
#Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world banking analytics use case focused on financial risk monitoring, customer behavior analysis, and portfolio performance. Using SQL, it analyzes customer accounts, transactions, and loan data to generate actionable insights for credit risk teams and business stakeholders.

#Business Objectives

*Identify customers with overdue loans and assess credit risk
*Prioritize high-value customers with significant loan exposure
*Analyze customer cash-flow behavior (credit vs debit)
*Evaluate regional performance and risk-adjusted balance strength
*Provide executive-level portfolio health metrics

#Database Schema

*customers: customer demographics and segments
*accounts: account types and balances
*transactions: credit and debit transaction history
*loans: loan amount, status, and overdue days

Relational integrity is enforced using primary and foreign keys.

#Key Analyses

*Overdue loan identification and exposure analysis
*Top customers by balance and loan risk
*Segment-wise and region-wise risk profiling
*Transaction activity and average spend analysis
*Loan status distribution and product penetration

#Tools & Technologies

*MySQL
*SQL (Joins, Aggregations, CASE statements, Subqueries)

#How to Run

*Execute the SQL script in MySQL Workbench to create and populate the database
*Run the analytical queries to generate insights
*(Optional) Connect to Excel, Power BI, or Tableau for visualization
